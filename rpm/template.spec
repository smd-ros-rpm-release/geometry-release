%description
This package contains a set of conversion functions to convert common tf
datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into semantically identical datatypes used
by other libraries. The conversion functions make it easier for users of the
transform library (tf) to work with the datatype of their choice. Currently this
package has support for the Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen
matrix library. This package is stable, and will get integrated into tf in the
next major release cycle (see roadmap).
